# Food-Ordering-System
Food Ordering System is a web based project in which we can order the food from the website. To order the food the user has to register on the website and after the successful login, food ordering process takes place. The user can select the food and can add that food item in the list. The bill is calculated and the user can pay the bill through online card payment.
